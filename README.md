Creation of a portfolio page using bootstrap
You can access the page using the following link:

## Description

In this assigment we are asked to recreate our previous portfolio using bootstrap.

This activity has been a good exercise to get used to working with bootstrap.
It certainly makes pages look more polished although I initially thought it was going to be easier.
I found that all the syntax used in bootstrap may be a bit confusing.


## Usage

The portfolio page consists of a single page. It has a nav menu at the top of the page that will link you to the relevant sections.
If you hover the buttons, a shadow will show and the mouse icon will change into a hand showing that you can interact with it.
The first two examples in the work section link to my previous work. For the rest of the images I have used a placeholder.

## Credits

For this project I have been inspired by the work done during the 3rd week of the bootcamp.
For the HeroSection I have used a similar item to the one used for the Travel California project.
For the Contact Me section I have also been inspirted by the testimonials section in the california project.
For the skills section I have tried to replicate the section used in the RockNation project.
